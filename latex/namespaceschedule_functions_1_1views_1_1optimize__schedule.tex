Run the clingo program for proposing an optimal schedule. 

Like with the conflict identifier, we randomly choose one section from each course to be called "{}critical"{}.

For each course in the input file, we suggest a new timeslot. A timeslot if an object encoding the start time, end time, and day of a particular section. These timeslots are restricted to credit hours. For example, some timeslots are only for 1 credit hour courses, while others are for 3 credit hour courses.

We then ensure that no two sections are in the same room at the same time, and no professors are scheduled for two or more sections at the same time.

We then define conflict such that two sections have overlapping times, overlapping days, and are not sections of the same class.

We then define a critical conflict to be if two critical sections of the same year (ie, two 3000 level courses) are in conflict.

We then minimize the count of critical conflicts. As a secondary objective, we additionally minimize the number of changes from the original schedule.

In progress\+: Working on implementing professor preferences as tertiary objectives such as\+:

\item Morning times
\item Afternoon times
\item Back to back times
\item Monday/\+Wednesday Dayslots
\item Tuesday/\+Thursday Dayslots
