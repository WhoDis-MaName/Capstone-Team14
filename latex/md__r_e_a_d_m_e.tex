This project aims to identify conflicting courses that students are likely to take simultaneously and propose a new schedule without conflicts. The main objectives include\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Identifying Time Conflicts}} between classes commonly taken in the same semester.
\item {\bfseries{Optimizing the Schedule}} to minimize conflicts with minimal changes to the original schedule.
\item {\bfseries{Handle Professor Preferences}} -\/ Given a list of professor preferences, respect these preferences during the optimization step.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Each course as a list of sections which encode the following information\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Unique Section ID
\item Section number (ie\+: 001)
\item Section timeslot (Start time, End time, Days)
\item Room
\item Professor
\end{DoxyItemize}

There is a {\bfseries{scheduling conflict}} between two sections if they\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Have the overlapping times {\bfseries{and}} overlapping days
\item Are predicted to be taken during the same year
\item Are {\bfseries{not}} sections of the same course or cross listed together.
\end{DoxyItemize}

We randomly assign one section to be labeled the {\bfseries{critical section}} for each course. There is a {\bfseries{critical conflict}} between two courses if their {\bfseries{critical sections}} are in conflict.

After identifying the critical conflicts, the next step is to suggest a reorganized schedule. The optimization criteria include\+:

\item {\bfseries{Minimize the number of preference violations.}}
\item {\bfseries{Minimize the number of changes to the original schedule.}}

To run the project, simply launch your virtual environment using\+:

{\ttfamily source myenv/bin/activate}

After entering virtual environment, download Django\+:

{\ttfamily pip install -\/r requirements.\+txt}

Also Following the steps to install Clingo\+:

To Launch the current iteration of project, use these commands from inside the root directory for the project (Capstone-\/14)\+:

\item This release has mainly included a foundation for each section(front-\/end, back-\/end, and ASP). We\textquotesingle{}ve created basic python scripts for parsing through the schedule JSON file and a simple pipeline to convert the filtered CSCI class into ASP formatted rules and constraints. From this, we\textquotesingle{}re able to run a basic constraint identifier that returns which classes conflict with one another. Additionally, we were able to set up two basic buttons that execute this "{}\+Run Filterer"{} and "{}\+Run Processor"{}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

To launch django tests, use this command\+:

{\ttfamily python \doxylink{manage_8py}{manage.\+py} test}

We also integrated pytest to test the clingo code. To use pytest, navigate to {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}testing\textbackslash{}clingo\+\_\+tests} and use this command\+:

{\ttfamily pytest -\/v .\textbackslash{}\doxylink{clingo__pytest_8py}{clingo\+\_\+pytest.\+py}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Docker Deployment}{Docker Deployment}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}

{\ttfamily sudo docker build -\/t capstone-\/14\+:latest .}

Run the container using\+:

{\ttfamily sudo docker run -\/-\/name capstone-\/14 -\/p 8000\+:8000 capstone-\/14}

can use {\ttfamily -\/t} to specify number of threads for clingo. Ie\+: {\ttfamily clingo overlap\+\_\+minizer.\+lp -\/t 8}.

The following code shows how to run Clingo with a few different options. We have {\ttfamily -\/-\/opt-\/mode=optN} which shows multiple optimal models. {\ttfamily 10} means only show {\ttfamily 10} optimal models. {\ttfamily -\/t 2} means use 2 threads\+:

{\ttfamily clingo -\/-\/opt-\/mode=optN ../media/uploads/raw\+\_\+input5.lp .\textbackslash{}overlap\+\_\+minimizer.\+lp 10 -\/t 2}

This can be called through python with the following\+:

{\bfseries{Clingo changes}}\+:

Updated the clingo files to identify and optimize based on total overlap.

We have conflict if\+: s1, s2 have overlapping day, time, and are different classes We have overlap if every section in C1, C2 are in conflict -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} no valid path Overlaps are then weighted by group.

Current groups are based on the four year plan.

Group 1 includes all the classes predicted to take in year 1, Group 2 year 2, ... Group 0 includes all classes not in the four year plan.

Current weights are set to 2 if in Group 1-\/4, 1 if in group 0. Can be adjusted as inputs.

Weighted overlap = W1 + W2, where W1 is the weight of class 1, W2 is the weight of class 2.

Minimize based on weighted overlap. Additionally, minimize number of changes to the input schedule (lower priority).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Version 2.\+0 release notes\+:}{Version 2.\+0 release notes\+:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md17}
{\bfseries{Clingo changes}}\+:

Updated the clingo files to identify and optimize based on critical sections.

Before with the notion of total overlap, we could only ever guarantee that any given 2 courses could be taken at the same time.

With the definition of critical sections, we can now guarantee that, for courses of the same year, you can at least take the critical sections at the same time for any number of classes.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed weights based off classes in the four year plan
\item All classes now have the same weight
\item Only counting conflicts for classes of the same year
\item Refactored clingo code to compute optimal answer sets quickly (in a matter of seconds rather than minutes)
\item Added in logic to handle professor preferences
