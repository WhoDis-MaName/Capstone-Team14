.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 

.SH "Project Overview"
.PP
This project aims to identify overlapping courses that students are likely to take simultaneously and propose a new schedule without conflicts\&. The main objectives include:

.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fBIdentifying time conflicts\fP between classes commonly taken in the same semester\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fBOptimizing the schedule\fP to minimize conflicts and prioritize key courses\&.
.IP "3." 4
\fBCoordinating the schedule with shuttle timings\fP to reduce student wait times\&.
.PP

.PP
.PP
.SH "Identifying Course Overlaps"
.PP
A course overlap is defined as a scheduling conflict where two classes occur during the same time slot (same day and time, e\&.g\&., Tuesday/Thursday) under the following conditions:

.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fBStrict Overlap\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
The same time \fBand\fP the same day \fBand\fP either:
.IP "    \(bu" 6
The same professor, or
.IP "    \(bu" 6
The same room\&.
.PP

.IP "  \(bu" 4
At least one class should remain conflict-free if multiple sections exist\&.
.PP

.IP "2." 4
\fBHandling Multiple Sections\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
If multiple sections of a class are available (e\&.g\&., "AI" taught by different professors), should we ensure at least one section remains conflict-free, or that all sections avoid conflicts with other courses?
.PP

.PP

.PP
.PP
.SH "Key Classes to Prioritize"
.PP
Certain courses should be given priority when resolving conflicts:

.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fBCore CS Courses\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Examples: Calculus I, CS II, Intro to Proofs, Discrete Math, Theory of Computation, Computer Networks, Software Engineering\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Classes with prerequisites can overlap with their prerequisite courses since students typically won't take both in the same semester\&.
.PP

.IP "2." 4
\fBCore Concentration Classes\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Examples: NLP, AI, Game Design\&.
.PP

.IP "3." 4
\fB4000-Level Courses\fP (Priority for seniors)
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Ensuring upper-level students can take required courses without conflicts\&.
.PP

.PP

.PP
\fBExample Case:\fP A senior pursuing a Computer Science or AI degree may need both \fIIntro to AI\fP and \fIMachine Learning & Data Mining\fP\&. These courses should not be scheduled at the same time\&.

.PP
.PP
.SH "Optimization Approach"
.PP
After identifying conflicts, the next step is to suggest a reorganized schedule with minimal conflicts\&. The optimization criteria include:

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBMinimizing the number of overlapping classes\&.\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBPrioritizing senior-level courses\fP to ensure timely graduation\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBConsidering different optimization strategies:\fP
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Reducing overall conflicts\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Assigning weights to courses to prioritize essential ones\&.
.PP

.PP

.PP
.PP
.SH "Coordinating with Shuttle Schedule"
.PP
The final step involves aligning the course schedule with the universityâ€™s shuttle service to minimize student wait times\&.

.PP
.PP
.SH "Additional Optimization Considerations"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
A secondary \fBAnswer Set Programming (ASP) model\fP will take the optimized schedule and refine it further with minimal disruption\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Weak constraints can have different weights to reflect course importance\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBTODO:\fP Read more on soft constraints and optimization techniques\&.
.PP

.PP
.PP
.SH "Future Improvements"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fine-tune soft constraints and optimization approaches\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Gather feedback from students and faculty to refine scheduling priorities\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Explore additional factors such as professor availability and classroom constraints\&.
.PP

.PP
.PP
.SH "Conclusion"
.PP
This project provides an optimized class schedule by reducing conflicts, prioritizing key courses, and considering shuttle coordination\&. The optimization process balances multiple factors to ensure students can take the courses they need without unnecessary scheduling conflicts\&.
.SH "Release Notes Version 1\&.3"
.PP
.SS "Command Line Deployment"
To run the project, simply launch your virtual environment using:

.PP
\fRsource myenv/bin/activate\fP

.PP
After entering virtual environment, download Django:

.PP
\fRpip install -r requirements\&.txt\fP

.PP
Also Following the steps to install Clingo:

.PP
https://github.com/potassco/clingo?tab=readme-ov-file

.PP
To Launch the current iteration of project, use this command:

.PP
\fRpython \fBmanage\&.py\fP runserver\fP

.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
This release has mainly included a foundation for each section(front-end, back-end, and ASP)\&. We've created basic python scripts for parsing through the schedule JSON file and a simple pipeline to convert the filtered CSCI class into ASP formatted rules and constraints\&. From this, we're able to run a basic constraint identifier that returns which classes conflict with one another\&. Additionally, we were able to set up two basic buttons that execute this "Run Filterer" and "Run Processor"\&.
.PP

.PP
To launch django tests, use this command:

.PP
\fRpython \fBmanage\&.py\fP test\fP

.PP
We also integrated pytest to test the clingo code\&. To use pytest, navigate to \fR\\testing\\clingo_tests\fP and use this command:

.PP
\fRpytest -v \&.\\\fBclingo_pytest\&.py\fP\fP
.SS "Docker Deployment"
To build the docker containter image, move to the root directory for the repository and run:

.PP
\fRdocker build capstone-14:latest\fP

.PP
Run the container using:

.PP
\fRdocker run --name capstone-14 -p 8000:8000 capstone-14\fP

.PP
\fINote\fP the docker deployment will not perform any tests\&.
